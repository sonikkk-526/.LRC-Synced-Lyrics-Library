## ■ About this repository
Ok. One of my hobbies is being an audiophile, but staring at a few of my multi-billion dollars headphones is pointless. Therefore, I do also like to collect lossless audio/songs and play them with [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/). I listen to English (Pop, Hip-hop), J-Pop (Anime, Pop, etc) and Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese).

For those who will be/already using lossless audio, when you compare it with a streaming service such as Apple Music or Spotify, you will find yourself losing the synced lyrics function; that's why you mix and match lossless files (ie: .FLAC/.WAV) with synced lyrics (ie: .LRC/.SRT) to compensate it.

_Since I cannot share my collection of lossless files (as they cost money and it is illegal); I can share my collection of synced lyrics._

    | This repository is for sharing my collection of .LRC synced lyrics.

## ■ How are they created
For transparency, the .LRC files are created in two ways:
 1. Downloaded from [YouTube (.SRT)](https://downsub.com/) then converted to [.LRC](https://toolslick.com/conversion/subtitle/srt-to-lrc) using the mentioned existing tools; further adjustments maybe required (such as changing the language of the lyrics (just Google to see if someone made the lyrics of the song in your langauge) or mismatched timestamps).
 2. My ears, my eyes, my hand, and [my tool](https://github.com/sonikkk-526/Lyrics-Editor-for-.LRC).

If you need to (a.) shift the timestamp by ±X.XX seconds, or (b.) keeping the timestamp but changing the lyrics to another language with existing set, you may try out [my tool (Lyrics Editor for .LRC)](https://github.com/sonikkk-526/Lyrics-Editor-for-.LRC).

## ■ "One" last side note
Please also be informed that the majority of the J-Pop and Chinese .LRC files are in Chinese (Traditional). However, it is way more important to have the timestamp of the lyrics instead of the lyrics itself. You can always change the lyrics by searching on Google whether someone posted the lyrics in your language and merge it with [my tool](https://github.com/sonikkk-526/Lyrics-Editor-for-.LRC), or choices of yours.

This repo is updated manually. It used the Windows ["`XCOPY`"](https://ss64.com/nt/xcopy.html) function to copy and paste the .LRC files from my collection to this repo. I cannot garentee regular updates in this repo but I will try my best to keep it up-to-date.
